\frametitle{Importing Scripts}
In order to inform Python that the executable part of a script should not be executed when importing this we can use the following:
^^I^^I\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
<non executable code>
if __name__ == "__main__":
    <executable code>
\end{lstlisting}
^^I^^IUnder the \texttt{if} statement we put any code we want to be executed whenever the script is directly called while outside it we put any ``importable'' code, e.g., function declarations.
